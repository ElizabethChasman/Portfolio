<p>A fun fact about me is that in middle school I dyed my hair blue. The blue quickly faded to a greyish green color because I was diving almost everyday and chlorine did not mix well with dyed hair. I dyed my hair again in my freshman year of highschool and I really regret it to this day. It looked pretty bad so i dedcided to dye it back to brown/black. That did not work and now my hair is a very odd brownish greenish yellow</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy reading or swimming. When I was younger I wanted to be a mermaid. Its embarressing now but I still think it would be cool to be one. You could breathe underwater and have an cool tail to make you swim super fast and swim wherever you want.</p>
