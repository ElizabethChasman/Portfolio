<p>My name is Elizabeth Noelle Chasman. I am fourteen years old and will be a sophmore at Pittsford Mendon Highschool in september.</p>
<p>A fun fact about me is that in middle school I dyed my hair blue. The blue quickly faded to a greyish green color because I was in a pool almost everyday and the chlorine did not mix well with dyed hair. I dyed my hair blonde in my freshman year of highschool and I still really regret it. I tried to dye it back to my natural hair color (a dark brown) that did not work and now my hair is a very odd brownish greenish yellow</p>
<p>In my free time I enjoy reading or swimming. Every year my family goes to florida, I love reading on the beach or swimming in the ocean.</p>
